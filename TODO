FROM AUG 4 MEETING:
- Online site on Heroku
  - Seems fine
- Data entry primary
  - Fine
- Name tags & stickers
  - We already have some hanging tags
  - Stickers are fine
- When is next workshop?
  - October
- BEP is interested in sharing the software with JTC, MoE, etc.

- It's okay for the numbers to change each workshop

- Need to get meanings of those position codes

- Don't use numbers with a '666' string, just generate another (makes it easier...)
- Put the name of the institution in charge on the title bar, to differentiate JTC Train Track from BEP Train Track
- Add people from institution page, AJAX-style just like on workshop page (for speed entry)
- Need to generate report like the sheet I was shown: Overall Attendance Tracking Report
- Should use javascript to set title automatically if gender changes and mismatches
- Make it more convenient to use only keyboard when entering in large numbers of attendees
- Remember school when restarting attendee-entry form; will be common to enter in multiple people from the same school
- Perhaps use universal person train codes (would require changing the train_code plugin)
- When processing train code, use a replace distance algorithm:
  - For each quadrant that has all four digits, figure out what the other quadrants should be, then check character similarity vs. actual quadrants
- Ignore mostly blank scanned inputs silently (somebody started filling it in, then said forget it)
- Workshop session needs a "room" field
- Editing appointment attendance - sort sessions.
- Can teleform be told that 9's are disallowed? It tends to guess 9 instead of 5.
- Can teleform be told to turn off insert-style editing in the verif stage?
- Can teleform auto-commit after verification?
- Times are shown in UTC, n ot local
- Use the school code to identify institutions uniquely
- Look into printing string nametags, to which stickers are attached
- Figure out why the printer is so slow
- Rename Appointment model to Participant, come up with a new concept name for what is now Appointment::role
- Make 'job title' (aka role) part of appointment, not person (as it can change over time)
- Add a field to show the organization the installation belongs to (so an MoE Train Track can be easily identified vs a BEP installation)
- Show verification error on uniqueness violations
- Keep track of what's been printed, allow easy re-printing of a given batch
- Fill in the bottom part of the form with X's so that people aren't tempted to write "extra" numbers there
- Reload workshop show page after generating a print list
- Rename 'trainer' to 'presenter'
- Use the index to grab new random identifiers
- Refactor! Ye gods, refactor! Especially application.dryml and the workshop_sessions/appointments controllers
- After adding a session, reset focus to session name text box and clear contents
- Should be possible to alter a session's start time from its edit page
- Maybe give sessions a show page which lists all the people who attended that session
- The attendance editor for appointments should order the sessions by their start time, and use WorkshopSession.to_s
- Always replace "&" with "and" when inserting/updating/searching institution names
  - Similarly, "PJH" -> "Primary and Junior High", "Inf" -> "Infant", "AA" -> "All Age", "JH" -> "Junior High", etc.
  - Possibly remove all these sorts of things from the title entirely, since there seems to be a lot of confusion around this
- Allow for tracking non-schools as organizations participants can come from (i.e. Ministry of Ed, Education Officers, etc.)
- Add more constraints, attr_protected/attr_readonly where necessary (especially random_identifier)
- Make sure parish matches region
- Maybe make parish in institution optional (for more abstract organizations)
- Region selection with radio buttons, not dropdown
- Include numbers on the registration sheet, and include that number in the output XML file if possible
- Move XML processing to its own page, and allow manual viewing of the processed files log
  - Show files which are matched to a workshop and session but not to an attendee on the workshop's page, with a "resolved" button
  - However, files where most of the attendee boxes are left blank are not marked in this way
- Speed up the workshop display page when showing large numbers of attendees
- Integrate with offline mirror ; keep an online version on heroku, and allow workshop checkout and checkin
- Allow guessing from a single number in the code (maybe with some way to make sure code matches directly in at least one quadrant?)
- It would be really really really nice if I could get TeleForm to export the image of the field along with the data
  - I'm dreaming, aren't I?
    - Yep, totally dreaming.
    - If I'm not dreaming, though, allow user to type in correct number within Train Track, and have it re-attempt the match
- Have a special session which is for registration, with its own form that includes a signature field
  - Have a toggle button available AJAXily within the appointment card to toggle registration status (with a msg box confirm)
- When a name is typed in, allow these options:
  - Show similar names (indicating if they're already registered with this workshop or not, and what their last institution was)
  - Allow creating a new person
  - Allow changing an existing person to a new institution (if they're already in this workshop under another institution)
- DO NOT allow changing which person an appointment refers to while maintaining the participant code. That way lies madness.
- Allow printing of stickers for people directly from app
  - Keep track of appointments which need stickers re-printed (new, or person/institution changed)
    - Do it by giving appointment a dirty_sticker flag default true, and updating person/institution/appt sets flag to true
  - Allow economical page use - start from unused part of sticker page (with a manual reset option)
  - Print multiples vertically, not horizontally
- Allow non-schools to be participants
- Allow tracking attendance/registration for presenters
- The "new appointment/session" form should itself be in a card, so that it can "turn into" the card with the new data
- Require javascript
- Maybe keep appointments in a paginated table-plus instead of a selection of cards
  - Can table-plus do AJAX sorting? AJAX pagination? AJAX searching? Most importantly, AJAX insertions and deletions?
- MoE people aren't all from region 1 - need to re-think relationship between institution and region
- Allow in-place AJAX editing of appointments, including attendances
- First row of generated CSV should be a title row


For each workshop there are several sessions, each of which can apply their hours to different categories, i.e.:
	- Leadership
	- Numeracy
	- Literacy
	- etc.

Need to investigate teleform for the quickest possible way to mark attendance. Note that many people will show up late.
Also needs to be possible to correct attendance information afterwards (maybe as an intermediary check process before commit)

Need to submit information to Trainet:
	- Automatically if possible

Reports:
	- Workshop attendance report:
		- Gender percentage
		- Job description
	- Person:
		- How many workshops they attended
		- How many hours of training
		- Which workshops they misseds
	- Overall summary:
		- Average attendance percentage, gender percentage
		- For all workshops, or by region
		- Limited by date optionally
		- Number of people-hours granted (subset by gender, job description, region, IR, etc.)

Job descriptions:
	- People who don't work for the school and are hired by the Ministry
		- Job description
	- People who work at the school
		- Job description: Principal, Vice Principal, Senior Teacher, Teacher, etc.
		- Grades taught (optional, multiple selection possible)

- For each person, need to be able to show total hours accumulated, also hours for each IR (and maybe subcompontents)
- Don't need to manually associate IRs with people, just determine that from what sessions they attend
			
( IR : Intermediate Requirement, aka an objective )
- Literacy IR1
- Numeracy IR2
- Leadership IR4

- For administrators, just need a certain total number of hours, not in any particular thing

Sepeately tracked subcomponents, with separate hour gathering
Subcompontents can add to multiple IRs hour counts
	- I.e. numeracy management gives hours to Numeracy IR2 and also to Leadership IR4

- Also need to keep track of hours acquired by people trained indirectly, who didn't attend a BEP workshop

- Main focus on number of people trained to be trainers
- Also need to show total impact

- Each training session can either be training people to be trainers, or training people directly
	- These need to be tracked seperately, but also summed in some reports

- Do we care about people who were supposed to attend but didn't?
	- Need to know because then regions need to follow up with absentees, on a per workshop basis

- Each session can either be training TOT or not, may need to report the difference (or maybe not)

- Tracking school attendance:
	- If anyone from a school is at a workshop, school is *represented* at the workshop; otherwise they're not
	- Need to have reports on this, a separate concept from tracking person-hours

- How to track indirect training?
	- Do NOT care about non-BEP schools
	- Want reports of whether or not indirect training is happening at each school
	- But hours don't care if they are direct or indirect
