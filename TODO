For each workshop there are several sessions, each of which can apply their hours to different categories, i.e.:
	- Leadership
	- Numeracy
	- Literacy
	- etc.

Need to investigate teleform for the quickest possible way to mark attendance. Note that many people will show up late.
Also needs to be possible to correct attendance information afterwards (maybe as an intermediary check process before commit)

Need to submit information to Trainet:
	- Automatically if possible

Reports:
	- Workshop attendance report:
		- Gender percentage
		- Job description
	- Person:
		- How many workshops they attended
		- How many hours of training
		- Which workshops they misseds
	- Overall summary:
		- Average attendance percentage, gender percentage
		- For all workshops, or by region
		- Limited by date optionally
		- Number of people-hours granted (subset by gender, job description, region, IR, etc.)

Job descriptions:
	- People who don't work for the school and are hired by the Ministry
		- Job description
	- People who work at the school
		- Job description: Principal, Vice Principal, Senior Teacher, Teacher, etc.
		- Grades taught (optional, multiple selection possible)

- For each person, need to be able to show total hours accumulated, also hours for each IR (and maybe subcompontents)
- Don't need to manually associate IRs with people, just determine that from what sessions they attend
			
( IR : Intermediate Requirement, aka an objective )
- Literacy IR1
- Numeracy IR2
- Leadership IR4

- For administrators, just need a certain total number of hours, not in any particular thing

Sepeately tracked subcomponents, with separate hour gathering
Subcompontents can add to multiple IRs hour counts
	- I.e. numeracy management gives hours to Numeracy IR2 and also to Leadership IR4

- Also need to keep track of hours acquired by people trained indirectly, who didn't attend a BEP workshop

- Main focus on number of people trained to be trainers
- Also need to show total impact

- Each training session can either be training people to be trainers, or training people directly
	- These need to be tracked seperately, but also summed in some reports

- Do we care about people who were supposed to attend but didn't?
	- Need to know because then regions need to follow up with absentees, on a per workshop basis

- Should use javascript to set title automatically if gender changes and mismatches

- Each session can either be training TOT or not, may need to report the difference (or maybe not)

- Tracking school attendance:
	- If anyone from a school is at a workshop, school is *represented* at the workshop; otherwise they're not
	- Need to have reports on this, a separate concept from tracking person-hours

- How to track indirect training?
	- Do NOT care about non-BEP schools
	- Want reports of whether or not indirect training is happening at each school
	- But hours don't care if they are direct or indirect
