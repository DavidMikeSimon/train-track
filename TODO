- Add to people report:
  - Column for each workshop attended, each showing the date of first session attended that workshop, and number of hours
- Make "grade" a text field that allows multiple grades to be entered in
- Refactor view stuff:
  - Nicer CSS
  - Get rid of all the nbsp junk, use styled ul instead
- Add a id printing setup page to choose number of labels per person and page start position
  - Keep those settings maintained in the workshop model
  - Test the mid-page start thing so I can come up with some coherent instructions
- IMPORTANT MODEL ADJUSTMENT:
  - People need to be strongly associated with the last school they attended a wkshop for; make this available even for people with 0 attendances
  - Some chairmen are attending a workshop for multiple schools
  - Allow non-chairmen to be assoc with multiple schools, but issue a warning (maybe?)
- Don't use numbers with a '666' or '1313' string (ignoring dashes), just generate another (makes it easier...)
- When processing train code, use a replace distance algorithm
- Add a field to show the organization the installation belongs to (so an MoE Train Track can be easily identified vs a BEP installation)
  - Put the name of the institution in charge on the title bar, to differentiate JTC Train Track from BEP Train Track
- Add people from institution page, AJAX-style just like on workshop page (for speed entry)
- Should use javascript to set title automatically if gender changes and mismatches
- Make it more convenient to use only keyboard when entering in large numbers of attendees
- Remember school when restarting attendee-entry form; will be common to enter in multiple people from the same school
- Ignore mostly blank scanned inputs silently (somebody started filling it in, then said forget it)
- Workshop session needs a "room" field
- Can teleform be told that 9's are disallowed? It tends to guess 9 instead of 5.
- Can teleform be told to turn off insert-style editing in the verif stage?
- Can teleform auto-commit after verification?
- Times are shown in UTC, not local
- Use the school code to identify institutions uniquely
- Figure out why the printer is so slow
- Rename Appointment model to Participant, come up with a new concept name for what is now Appointment::role
- Show verification error on uniqueness violations
- Reload workshop show page after generating a print list
- Rename 'trainer' to 'presenter'
- Refactor! Ye gods, refactor! Especially the workshop_sessions/appointments controllers
- After adding a session, reset focus to session name text box and clear contents
- Use a better way of editing attendance data
  - JSAS prototype table?
- Always replace "&" with "and" when inserting/updating/searching institution names
  - Similarly, "PJH" -> "Primary and Junior High", "Inf" -> "Infant", "AA" -> "All Age", "JH" -> "Junior High", etc.
  - Possibly remove all these sorts of things from the title entirely, since there seems to be a lot of confusion around this
- Allow for tracking non-schools as organizations participants can come from (i.e. Ministry of Ed, Education Officers, etc.)
- Add more constraints, attr_protected/attr_readonly where necessary (especially random_identifier)
- Make sure parish matches region
- Maybe make parish in institution optional (for more abstract organizations)
- Region selection with radio buttons, not dropdown
- Include numbers on the registration sheet, and include that number in the output XML file if possible
- Move XML processing to its own page, and allow manual viewing of the processed files log
  - Show files which are matched to a workshop and session but not to an attendee on the workshop's page, with a "resolved" button
- Speed up the workshop display page when showing large numbers of attendees
- Integrate with offline mirror ; keep an online version on heroku, and allow workshop checkout and checkin
- When a name is typed in, allow these options:
  - Show similar names (indicating if they're already registered with this workshop or not, and what their last institution was)
  - Allow creating a new person
  - Allow changing an existing person to a new institution (if they're already in this workshop under another institution)
- DO NOT allow changing which person an appointment refers to while maintaining the participant code. That way lies madness.
- Allow tracking attendance/registration for presenters
- The "new appointment/session" form should itself be in a card, so that it can "turn into" the card with the new data
- Require javascript
- Maybe keep appointments in a paginated table-plus instead of a selection of cards
  - Can table-plus do AJAX sorting? AJAX pagination? AJAX searching? Most importantly, AJAX insertions and deletions?
- MoE people aren't all from region 1 - need to re-think relationship between institution and region
- Allow in-place AJAX editing of appointments, including attendances


Need to submit information to Trainet:
	- Automatically if possible

Reports:
	- Workshop attendance report:
		- Gender percentage
		- Job description
	- Person:
		- How many workshops they attended
		- How many hours of training
		- Which workshops they misseds
	- Overall summary:
		- Average attendance percentage, gender percentage
		- For all workshops, or by region
		- Limited by date optionally
		- Number of people-hours granted (subset by gender, job description, region, IR, etc.)

Job descriptions:
	- People who don't work for the school and are hired by the Ministry
		- Job description
	- People who work at the school
		- Job description: Principal, Vice Principal, Senior Teacher, Teacher, etc.
		- Grades taught (optional, multiple selection possible)

- For each person, need to be able to show total hours accumulated, also hours for each IR (and maybe subcompontents)
- Don't need to manually associate IRs with people, just determine that from what sessions they attend
			
( IR : Intermediate Requirement, aka an objective )
- Literacy IR1
- Numeracy IR2
- Leadership IR4

- For administrators, just need a certain total number of hours, not in any particular thing

Sepeately tracked subcomponents, with separate hour gathering
Subcompontents can add to multiple IRs hour counts
	- I.e. numeracy management gives hours to Numeracy IR2 and also to Leadership IR4

- Also need to keep track of hours acquired by people trained indirectly, who didn't attend a BEP workshop

- Main focus on number of people trained to be trainers
- Also need to show total impact

- Each training session can either be training people to be trainers, or training people directly
	- These need to be tracked seperately, but also summed in some reports

- Do we care about people who were supposed to attend but didn't?
	- Need to know because then regions need to follow up with absentees, on a per workshop basis

- Each session can either be training TOT or not, may need to report the difference (or maybe not)

- Tracking school attendance:
	- If anyone from a school is at a workshop, school is *represented* at the workshop; otherwise they're not
	- Need to have reports on this, a separate concept from tracking person-hours

- How to track indirect training?
	- Do NOT care about non-BEP schools
	- Want reports of whether or not indirect training is happening at each school
	- But hours don't care if they are direct or indirect
