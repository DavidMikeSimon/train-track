**** BEFORE WEDNESDAY (in order of decreasing priority) ****
- Allow importing attendance codes from teleform to mark attendance (on form: include date and start time, even if it isn't in session currently)
- Should use javascript to set title automatically if gender changes and mismatches
- Make it more convenient to use only keyboard when entering in large numbers of attendees
- Remember school when restarting attendee-entry form; will be common to enter in multiple people from the same school


**** LONGER TERM ****
- Rename 'trainer' to 'presenter'
- Use the index to grab new random identifiers
- Refactor! Ye gods, refactor! Especially application.dryml and the workshop_sessions/appointments controllers
- After adding a session, reset focus to session name text box and clear contents
- After altering attendance for a participant, jump back to that participant's card on the page
- Should be possible to alter a session's start time from its edit page
- Maybe give sessions a show page which lists all the people who attended that session
- The attendance editor for appointments should order the sessions by their start time, and use WorkshopSession.to_s
- Always replace "&" with "and" when inserting/updating/searching institution names
  - Similarly, "PJH" -> "Primary and Junior High", "Inf" -> "Infant", "AA" -> "All Age", etc.
  - Possibly remove all these sorts of things from the title entirely, since there seems to be a lot of confusion around this
- Allow for tracking non-schools as organizations participants can come from (i.e. Ministry of Ed, Education Officers, etc.)
- Add more constraints
- Make sure parish matches region
- Maybe make parish in institution optional (for more abstract organizations)
- Region selection with radio buttons, not dropdown


For each workshop there are several sessions, each of which can apply their hours to different categories, i.e.:
	- Leadership
	- Numeracy
	- Literacy
	- etc.

Need to investigate teleform for the quickest possible way to mark attendance. Note that many people will show up late.
Also needs to be possible to correct attendance information afterwards (maybe as an intermediary check process before commit)

Need to submit information to Trainet:
	- Automatically if possible

Reports:
	- Workshop attendance report:
		- Gender percentage
		- Job description
	- Person:
		- How many workshops they attended
		- How many hours of training
		- Which workshops they misseds
	- Overall summary:
		- Average attendance percentage, gender percentage
		- For all workshops, or by region
		- Limited by date optionally
		- Number of people-hours granted (subset by gender, job description, region, IR, etc.)

Job descriptions:
	- People who don't work for the school and are hired by the Ministry
		- Job description
	- People who work at the school
		- Job description: Principal, Vice Principal, Senior Teacher, Teacher, etc.
		- Grades taught (optional, multiple selection possible)

- For each person, need to be able to show total hours accumulated, also hours for each IR (and maybe subcompontents)
- Don't need to manually associate IRs with people, just determine that from what sessions they attend
			
( IR : Intermediate Requirement, aka an objective )
- Literacy IR1
- Numeracy IR2
- Leadership IR4

- For administrators, just need a certain total number of hours, not in any particular thing

Sepeately tracked subcomponents, with separate hour gathering
Subcompontents can add to multiple IRs hour counts
	- I.e. numeracy management gives hours to Numeracy IR2 and also to Leadership IR4

- Also need to keep track of hours acquired by people trained indirectly, who didn't attend a BEP workshop

- Main focus on number of people trained to be trainers
- Also need to show total impact

- Each training session can either be training people to be trainers, or training people directly
	- These need to be tracked seperately, but also summed in some reports

- Do we care about people who were supposed to attend but didn't?
	- Need to know because then regions need to follow up with absentees, on a per workshop basis

- Each session can either be training TOT or not, may need to report the difference (or maybe not)

- Tracking school attendance:
	- If anyone from a school is at a workshop, school is *represented* at the workshop; otherwise they're not
	- Need to have reports on this, a separate concept from tracking person-hours

- How to track indirect training?
	- Do NOT care about non-BEP schools
	- Want reports of whether or not indirect training is happening at each school
	- But hours don't care if they are direct or indirect
