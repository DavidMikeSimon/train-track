For each workshop there are several sessions, each of which can apply their hours to different categories, i.e.:
	- Leadership
	- Numeracy
	- Literacy
	- etc.

Need to investigate teleform for the quickest possible way to mark attendance. Note that many people will show up late.
Also needs to be possible to correct attendance information afterwards (maybe as an intermediary check process before commit)

Need to submit information to Trainet:
	- Automatically if possible

Reports:
	- Workshop attendance report:
		- Gender percentage
		- Job description
	- Person:
		- How many workshops they attended
		- How many hours of training
		- Which workshops they misseds
	- Overall summary:
		- Average attendance percentage, gender percentage
		- For all workshops, or by region
		- Limited by date optionally
		- Number of people-hours granted (subset by gender, job description, region, IR, etc.)

Job descriptions:
	- People who don't work for the school and are hired by the Ministry
		- Job description
	- People who work at the school
		- Job description: Principal, Vice Principal, Senior Teacher, Teacher, etc.
		- Grades taught (optional, multiple selection possible)

- For each person, need to be able to show total hours accumulated, also hours for each IR (and maybe subcompontents)
- Don't need to manually associate IRs with people, just determine that from what sessions they attend
			
( IR : Intermediate Requirement, aka an objective )
- Literacy IR1
	Sepeately tracked subcomponents, with separate hour gathering (????? ASK SIMONE):
	- Literacy management
	- Literacy content
- Numeracy IR2
	- Also subcomponents
- Leadership IR4
	- Maybe not subcompontents? (???? ASK SIMONE)

- Also need to keep track of hours acquired by people trained indirectly, who didn't attend a BEP workshop

- Main focus on number of people trained to be trainers
- Also need to show total impact

- Each training session can either be training people to be trainers, or training people directly
	- These need to be tracked seperately, but also summed in some reports
	- Does meeeting IR hour requirements differentiate between TOT and non-TOT?
		???? ASK SIMONE

- Do we care about people who were supposed to attend but didn't? ???? ASK SIMONE
	- Need to know because then regions need to follow up with absentees, on a per workshop basis

- Should use javascript to set title automatically if gender changes and mismatches

- Tracking school attendance:
	- If anyone from a school is at a workshop, school is *represented* at the workshop; otherwise they're not
	- Need to have reports on this, a separate concept from tracking person-hours

- How to track indirect training?
	Issue of contention; particularly re: tracking non-BEP schools/staff
